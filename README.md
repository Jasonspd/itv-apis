### Technologies used

#### Webpack and Babel
Frontend code is run through Webpack which transpiles all the js and jsx through babel and bundles it into one neat file app.js which meets ES5 standards.

#### SASS
Webpack also watches for ```.scss``` files and turns them into css that can be used in the bundle

Just ```require``` or ```import``` the ```.scss``` file directly into your React code.

#### React Bootstrap
