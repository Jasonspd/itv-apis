#### Webpack and Babel
Frontend code is run through Webpack which transpiles all the js and jsx through babel and bundles it into one neat file app.js which meets ES5 standards.

Webpack also watches for ```.scss``` files and turns them into css that can be used in the bundle

Just ```require``` or ```import``` the ```.scss``` file directly into your React code.
